-- NOTE: catalog seeding is centralized in `seeds/catalog_seeds.sql`.
-- This file only keeps non-catalog dev data.

-- NOTE:
-- Do NOT seed a default admin user here (would require committing secrets).
-- Default admin is created by inventiv-api at boot using DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE (same mechanism dev/staging/prod).
